there are 3 pillar of web development 
    1. html 
    2. css 
    3. javascript

javascript is a high level language . 
human readable language is high level interpreted language 
javascript is a just in time compiled language 

what is interpreted vs compiled language ?
= interpreted language is executed line by line by an interpreter . that's mean the code is read , analyzed and run directly , without convert machine code . 

= compiled language first translate machine code by compiler
