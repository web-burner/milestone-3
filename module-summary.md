Variable in JavaScript
= variable is container where can store data . it means it is able to vary something.

there are 5 things to declare variable

1. var/let/const keyword for declare variable
2. meaningful name for variable
3. (=) equal sign to assign value
4. value of variable
5. semi-colon (;)

example :
var name = 'shaon';
let age = 23;
const nationality = 'Bangladeshi';
const isPoor = true;

if i declare a variable but don't assign value for it it will return undefined . 

for print the output 
console.log(variable name);

example: 
let age = 23;
console.log(age);
